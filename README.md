# Getting started with Next.js frontend and Golang backend
This is a boilerplate code to get started with Next.js and Golang

1. Install Nodejs and npm (nodejs.org) or by using nvm
2. Install golang (golang.org)
3. Check this file in the frontend directory for the Next.js section: readthis.md. For more info on Next.js, check the moreNexjs.md in the frontend directory
4. After completing the Next.js section, check the README.md file in the backend directory
